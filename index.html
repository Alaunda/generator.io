            <h2>Because I'm <em>your</em> ally. <br>Pun definitely intended.</h2>
            <p>My goal here is to give and share kindess with you. So you can carry it with you throughout your day and possibly share this with others. You are always deserving of kindess and so are others. I respect you, your pronouns, and your existence as it is. So if anything I say causes you to feel offended or unheard, I apologize fully and I want you to know I am constantly seeking advice, critique and revision. So let's start sharing kindess together!</p>

    <h3>Need More Help?</h3>
    <p>I am so sorry if the words and phrases didn't give you the level of comfort and unity you need. I will always be here as a source of wellness. My words and phrases have and will always be an attempt of care to (and for) you. But sometimes, this on it's own may not be enough. If you need more, that's okay and completely normal! So here is a list of hotlines, self help, and outreaches to further assist you in you journey. Your are loved, you <em>are</em> love and I have so much faith in you. Thank you for stopping by!</p>
